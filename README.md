✅ All Software Development Models (with Real-life Examples)


---

🟩 1. Waterfall Model

🔹 Definition:

Linear and step-by-step development. Once a phase is completed, we cannot go back.

🔹 Steps:

Requirement → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Building a house
You first finalize the plan, then construct foundation, walls, roof, and finally paint. You can’t paint before building the wall!



🔹 Software Example:

> Developing a fixed government system (e.g. Voter ID Registration System) where all requirements are known from the start.




---

🟩 2. V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)

🔹 Definition:

Extension of waterfall with testing at every stage. Each dev stage has a corresponding test stage.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Exam Preparation
You read a chapter (development), then solve questions or test yourself (validation) before going to the next chapter.



🔹 Software Example:

> Software for medical devices, where accuracy and testing at every level is critical.




---

🟩 3. Incremental Model

🔹 Definition:

Build the software in parts (increments). Each part adds new features.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Cooking meal in parts
First make roti, then sabzi, then rice. You can eat and continue cooking.



🔹 Software Example:

> Creating a shopping website where:



First release = login + view products

Second release = add to cart

Third release = payment system



---

🟩 4. Iterative Model

🔹 Definition:

Software is developed and improved through repeated cycles (iterations) based on feedback.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Drafting an essay
You write one version → get feedback → improve it again and again.



🔹 Software Example:

> Developing a blog website where after each version, user feedback is taken and features are added/improved.




---

🟩 5. Spiral Model

🔹 Definition:

Combines iteration + risk analysis. Suitable for large, high-risk projects.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Planning a wedding
You keep planning in phases:



Initial idea

Budget risks

Vendor booking

Feedback from family
Repeat until perfect.


🔹 Software Example:

> Building a defense control system or aircraft software, where safety and risk analysis are important.




---

🟩 6. Prototyping Model

🔹 Definition:

First build a sample (prototype) to show the client → get feedback → improve → then build actual system.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Trying clothes before buying
You try a sample shirt in trial room (prototype), then finalize.



🔹 Software Example:

> Designing a new mobile app UI — you make a clickable demo first to show how it works.




---

🟩 7. Agile Model

🔹 Definition:

An iterative, team-focused, and flexible approach. Software is built in small sprints (1–4 weeks).

🔹 Keywords:

Daily stand-ups

Continuous feedback

Customer collaboration


🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Group project in college
Every day team meets, discusses tasks, improves work. Changes are allowed anytime.



💡 What is MDD?
⭐ MDD = Model-Driven Development
MDD is a software development approach where you focus on creating models first, and then generate code from these models.


🔹 Software Example:

> Developing a Zomato-type app where customer needs change frequently.




---

🟩 8. RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)

🔹 Definition:

Focus on fast development using reusable components. Good for UI-heavy applications.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Making instant noodles
Instead of cooking from scratch, you use ready-made ingredients to save time.



🔹 Software Example:

> Building a hotel booking system quickly using pre-made templates and modules.




---

🟩 9. Big Bang Model

🔹 Definition:

No proper planning. Developers start coding randomly. Useful only for small, quick experiments.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Cramming a project last night before submission
You just start coding without thinking or planning — somehow get it done!



🔹 Software Example:

> A college mini-project made one day before deadline.




---

🟩 10. DevOps Model

🔹 Definition:

Combines development + operations. Focus on automation, CI/CD, and deployment.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Online kitchen + delivery team working together
Cook prepares food (dev), and delivery team immediately delivers it (ops), both working continuously.



🔹 Software Example:

> Building and managing Netflix, where features are updated daily and monitored 24/7.

Sure! Let’s break them down **very simply**, with easy language and examples.

---

## 🌟 **1️⃣ Scrum**

### What is it?

Scrum is an **agile framework** used for developing projects in **small pieces**, usually in short cycles called **sprints** (typically 2-4 weeks).

### How it works

* The team decides what work to do in the next sprint (called the **Sprint Planning**).
* They work on it for a fixed time (say, 2 weeks).
* At the end, they show the work (called a **Sprint Review**) and discuss improvements (**Retrospective**).

### Example

Imagine you are building a mobile app.

* In Sprint 1 (2 weeks), you focus only on login and sign-up screens.
* In Sprint 2, you add profile features.
* In Sprint 3, you add notifications.

Each sprint produces a **working part** of the app.

---

## 🌟 **2️⃣ Kanban**

### What is it?

Kanban is a **visual method** for managing work. It uses a **board with columns** like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

### How it works

* You write each task on a card or sticky note.
* Move the cards from left to right as work progresses.
* You focus on **continuous flow** instead of time-based sprints.

### Example

Imagine you run a small bakery.

* Your Kanban board has tasks: "Bake bread", "Make cake", "Pack orders".
* You start working on "Bake bread" and move it to "In Progress".
* When done, you move it to "Done" and pick the next task.

---

## 🌟 **3️⃣ Crystal XP (Crystal Clear / Crystal Extreme Programming)**

### What is it?

Crystal is a **family of agile methods**, focusing on **people and interaction**, not strict rules. It is flexible and adapts to the team size and project.

### How it works

* Encourages **frequent delivery**, continuous improvement, and **easy communication**.
* Less formal documentation.
* Teams decide their own processes and tools.

### Example

Suppose your small team (5 people) is building a website for a local shop.

* You all sit together, talk daily, share ideas directly.
* You make a small delivery every 1-2 weeks.
* You decide together if you want to add or remove practices depending on what works best.

# 🌟 **SDLC kya hota hai?**

**SDLC** ka full form hai **Software Development Life Cycle**.

👉 Ye ek **process hai software banane ka**, jisme step-by-step bataya jata hai:

* Software kaise plan karna hai
* Design kaise banana hai
* Code kaise likhna hai
* Test kaise karna hai
* Deploy kaise karna hai
* Maintain kaise karna hai

---

# ✅ **SDLC ke main phases**

## 1️⃣ **Requirement Analysis (Jarurat samajhna)**

* Yaha pe **customer ya user se baat karke** pata lagaya jata hai ki software se kya chahiye.
* Functional requirements & non-functional requirements note kiye jate hain.

### Example

Agar hum **online food delivery app** bana rahe hain, to requirements:

* User login kar sake
* Restaurants dekh sake
* Food order kar sake
* Payment online kar sake

---

## 2️⃣ **Feasibility Study (Sambhavna dekhna)**

* Check kiya jata hai ki software technically, financially, aur operationally **possible hai ya nahi**.
* Budget, resources, time sab consider kiya jata hai.

---

## 3️⃣ **Design (Software ka naksha banana)**

* Yaha pe **blueprint** banta hai.
* High-level design (architecture) and low-level design (detailed module design).

### Example

Food app ke liye:

* Frontend design: screens (home, cart, payment)
* Backend design: database (users, orders, restaurants)

---

## 4️⃣ **Implementation (Coding)**

* Design ke basis pe **actual code likhna start hota hai**.
* Developers code karte hain, modules banate hain.

---

## 5️⃣ **Testing**

* Code ko test kiya jata hai bugs, errors, aur requirement matching ke liye.
* Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing.

### Example

Check karna:

* Kya payment gateway sahi chal raha hai?
* Kya login ka flow sahi hai?
* Kya order sahi se place ho raha hai?

---

## 6️⃣ **Deployment (Launch karna)**

* Software ko **real environment me user ke liye launch** kiya jata hai.
* Kabhi kabhi "Beta version" pehle release hota hai.

---

## 7️⃣ **Maintenance**

* Errors fix karna, naye features add karna, security update dena.
* Continuous process hai.

### Example

Agar users bolen ki "Add wallet payment option", to maintenance me add hota hai.
