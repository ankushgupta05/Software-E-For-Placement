✅ All Software Development Models (with Real-life Examples)


---

🟩 1. Waterfall Model

🔹 Definition:

Linear and step-by-step development. Once a phase is completed, we cannot go back.

🔹 Steps:

Requirement → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Building a house
You first finalize the plan, then construct foundation, walls, roof, and finally paint. You can’t paint before building the wall!



🔹 Software Example:

> Developing a fixed government system (e.g. Voter ID Registration System) where all requirements are known from the start.




---

🟩 2. V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)

🔹 Definition:

Extension of waterfall with testing at every stage. Each dev stage has a corresponding test stage.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Exam Preparation
You read a chapter (development), then solve questions or test yourself (validation) before going to the next chapter.



🔹 Software Example:

> Software for medical devices, where accuracy and testing at every level is critical.




---

🟩 3. Incremental Model

🔹 Definition:

Build the software in parts (increments). Each part adds new features.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Cooking meal in parts
First make roti, then sabzi, then rice. You can eat and continue cooking.



🔹 Software Example:

> Creating a shopping website where:



First release = login + view products

Second release = add to cart

Third release = payment system



---

🟩 4. Iterative Model

🔹 Definition:

Software is developed and improved through repeated cycles (iterations) based on feedback.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Drafting an essay
You write one version → get feedback → improve it again and again.



🔹 Software Example:

> Developing a blog website where after each version, user feedback is taken and features are added/improved.




---

🟩 5. Spiral Model

🔹 Definition:

Combines iteration + risk analysis. Suitable for large, high-risk projects.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Planning a wedding
You keep planning in phases:



Initial idea

Budget risks

Vendor booking

Feedback from family
Repeat until perfect.


🔹 Software Example:

> Building a defense control system or aircraft software, where safety and risk analysis are important.




---

🟩 6. Prototyping Model

🔹 Definition:

First build a sample (prototype) to show the client → get feedback → improve → then build actual system.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Trying clothes before buying
You try a sample shirt in trial room (prototype), then finalize.



🔹 Software Example:

> Designing a new mobile app UI — you make a clickable demo first to show how it works.




---

🟩 7. Agile Model

🔹 Definition:

An iterative, team-focused, and flexible approach. Software is built in small sprints (1–4 weeks).

🔹 Keywords:

Daily stand-ups

Continuous feedback

Customer collaboration


🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Group project in college
Every day team meets, discusses tasks, improves work. Changes are allowed anytime.



🔹 Software Example:

> Developing a Zomato-type app where customer needs change frequently.




---

🟩 8. RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)

🔹 Definition:

Focus on fast development using reusable components. Good for UI-heavy applications.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Making instant noodles
Instead of cooking from scratch, you use ready-made ingredients to save time.



🔹 Software Example:

> Building a hotel booking system quickly using pre-made templates and modules.




---

🟩 9. Big Bang Model

🔹 Definition:

No proper planning. Developers start coding randomly. Useful only for small, quick experiments.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Cramming a project last night before submission
You just start coding without thinking or planning — somehow get it done!



🔹 Software Example:

> A college mini-project made one day before deadline.




---

🟩 10. DevOps Model

🔹 Definition:

Combines development + operations. Focus on automation, CI/CD, and deployment.

🧠 Daily Life Example:

> Online kitchen + delivery team working together
Cook prepares food (dev), and delivery team immediately delivers it (ops), both working continuously.



🔹 Software Example:

> Building and managing Netflix, where features are updated daily and monitored 24/7.

📌 Final Tip (For Interviews & Exams):

> 💡 Interviewer may ask:

“Which model did you use in your recent project?”

“Which SDLC model is best for startups?”

“Waterfall vs Agile difference?”




So understand the models with real-life examples — and connect it to your project or internship experience for strong answers!
