Got it bro 👍 Now I’ll give you slightly bigger answers in English (not too long, not too short). This way you can explain confidently in interview.

🔹 Standard Docker Interview Q&A (Simple English, Slightly Bigger)

1. What is Docker?

👉 Docker is a platform that allows us to run applications inside containers.
A container packages the app with all its dependencies so that it works the same on any system (developer laptop, testing, production, or cloud).


---

2. What is a Docker Image?

👉 A Docker Image is like a blueprint of the application.
It contains the source code, libraries, and environment settings.
Containers are created from images.


---

3. What is a Docker Container?

👉 A container is a running instance of an image.
It is a lightweight environment where the application runs, isolated from the host machine.


---

4. What is a Dockerfile?

👉 A Dockerfile is a text file that has step-by-step instructions to build an image.
Example: choose a base image, install dependencies, copy files, and run the app.


---

5. What is Docker Hub?

👉 Docker Hub is an online repository where we can store and share Docker images.
Example: docker pull python:3.9 downloads Python image from Docker Hub.


---

6. What is the difference between Docker and Virtual Machine?

👉 Virtual Machine (VM): Heavy, runs its own full OS.
👉 Docker: Lightweight, shares the host OS kernel.
Because of this, Docker is faster and uses fewer resources compared to VMs.


---

7. How to check running containers?

👉 Command:

docker ps

It shows all active containers.


---

8. How to build an image?

👉 Command:

docker build -t myimage .

This builds an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.


---

9. How to run a container?

👉 Command:

docker run myimage

This starts a container from the image.


---

10. How to stop and remove a container?

👉 Stop:

docker stop <container_id>

👉 Remove:

docker rm <container_id>


---

11. How to see all images?

👉 Command:

docker images


---

12. How to delete an image?

👉 Command:

docker rmi <image_id>


---

13. What is Docker Compose?

👉 Docker Compose is a tool to run multiple containers together using a single YAML file.
Example: Run Django + PostgreSQL + Redis with one command.


---

14. What are Docker Volumes used for?

👉 Volumes are used to store data permanently.
Even if a container is deleted, the data in the volume remains safe.


---

15. What is Port Mapping in Docker?

👉 Port mapping connects the container port to the host machine port.
Example:

docker run -p 8000:8000 myapp

Now app is available at localhost:8000.

👉 These are standard interview questions with clear answers.

Do you want me to also prepare a “short one-line version” of these answers (like a quick revision notes) so you can glance before interview?
