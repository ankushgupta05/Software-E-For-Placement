Samajh gaya bhai 👍 tumhe bohot saare question nahi chahiye, sirf limited aur most important AWS questions chahiye — jo Cloud Nexus interview me poore chance hai — aur answer simple English me, thoda long but easy samajhne layak.

Chalo main tumhe Top 10 AWS Important Questions with Answers deta hoon 👇

🔥 Cloud Nexus – Must-Prepare AWS Questions


---

1. What is AWS?

✅ Answer:
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that provides services like servers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet. Instead of buying physical servers, you can rent them from AWS and pay only for what you use.
It offers three main models:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Example – EC2 (virtual servers).

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Example – Elastic Beanstalk (deploy apps without worrying about servers).

SaaS (Software as a Service): Example – AWS WorkMail.


👉 In short, AWS helps companies save money, scale easily, and focus on building applications instead of managing hardware.


---

2. What is EC2 in AWS?

✅ Answer:
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service that provides virtual machines (servers) in the cloud.
With EC2 you can:

Launch servers in minutes.

Choose OS (Linux/Windows).

Control CPU, RAM, and storage.

Scale up or down as per demand.


👉 Example: If you want to host a website, you can launch an EC2 instance and install Apache or Nginx server on it.


---

3. What is S3 in AWS?

✅ Answer:
S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a service to store and retrieve unlimited data in the form of objects. It is highly durable (99.999999999% durability).

Key features:

Stores files like images, videos, logs.

Provides versioning (keeps old file versions).

Can make files public or private.

Commonly used for backup and static website hosting.


👉 Example: Storing user profile pictures in an S3 bucket.


---

4. What is IAM in AWS?

✅ Answer:
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is used for security and access control in AWS.
With IAM, you can:

Create users (like employees).

Assign them to groups (like admin, developer).

Give roles and permissions (who can access S3, who can launch EC2).


👉 Example: You can allow a developer to access S3 bucket but stop him from deleting EC2 instances.


---

5. What is Auto Scaling in AWS?

✅ Answer:
Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on demand.

👉 Example:

If traffic on your website increases, Auto Scaling will add more servers.

If traffic decreases at night, it will remove extra servers.
This saves cost and ensures high availability.



---

6. What is Load Balancer in AWS?

✅ Answer:
A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers so that no single server is overloaded.

👉 Example: If 1 lakh users open your website, the load balancer will spread the traffic across 5 servers instead of all going to 1 server.


---

7. What is RDS in AWS?

✅ Answer:
RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
AWS manages backups, patching, and scaling, so you don’t have to manage the database manually.

👉 Example: Instead of installing MySQL on EC2, you can directly use RDS for storing customer data.


---

8. What is AWS Lambda?

✅ Answer:
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service where you just upload your code, and AWS runs it whenever triggered (like an event or request). You don’t manage servers.

👉 Example: If an image is uploaded to S3, a Lambda function can automatically resize the image and save it.


---

9. What is VPC in AWS?

✅ Answer:
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like your own private network inside AWS. You can launch EC2, RDS, etc. in a secure environment with subnets, routing tables, and gateways.

👉 Example: A public subnet for your website, and a private subnet for your database that the internet cannot access directly.


---

10. What is CloudWatch?

✅ Answer:
CloudWatch is AWS’s monitoring service. It collects logs and metrics of AWS resources.

You can set alarms if CPU usage is too high.

It helps you understand performance and troubleshoot errors.


👉 Example: CloudWatch can send an alert if your EC2 CPU usage crosses 80%.


---

✅ These 10 questions are the most important for Cloud Nexus. Agar tum inko achhe se samjh kar answer karoge to interviewer ko lagega ki tumhe AWS basics + real use cases dono clear hain.


---

Bhai, kya mai inko aur thoda diagram / flow type example ke saath bana du (jaise Auto Scaling + Load Balancer ek chhota flow)? That will help you visualize and explain easily in interview.



Bilkul bhai 👍 ab tumhe thoda aur important AWS questions deta hoon — lekin phir bhi limited and practical rakhta hoon (not 50-100 list 😅). Ye wale Cloud Nexus jaise company definitely puch sakti hai, specially for Cloud + DevOps domain.

🔥 More Important AWS Interview Questions (Cloud Nexus)


---

11. Difference between S3, EBS, and EFS?

✅ Answer:

S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage, unlimited size, used for files, images, backups. Accessible via internet.

EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block storage attached to one EC2 instance, works like a hard disk.

EFS (Elastic File System): Shared file storage, can be mounted by many EC2 instances at the same time.


👉 Example:

Profile pictures → S3

Database storage → EBS

Shared project files → EFS



---

12. What is CloudFront?

✅ Answer:
CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN). It caches your website content (images, videos, HTML) in servers across the world, so users get fast access.

👉 Example: A user in India can get data from the nearest AWS edge location (like Mumbai) instead of the US server.


---

13. What is Route 53 in AWS?

✅ Answer:
Route 53 is AWS’s DNS (Domain Name System) service. It is used for:

Domain registration

Routing traffic to servers

Health checking of applications


👉 Example: www.mysite.com → maps to EC2 IP using Route 53.


---

14. What is Elastic Beanstalk?

✅ Answer:
Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS service to quickly deploy apps (Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, etc.) without managing infrastructure.

👉 Example: Upload your code → Beanstalk automatically creates EC2, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling.


---

15. What is the Shared Responsibility Model in AWS?

✅ Answer:
In AWS, security is shared:

AWS → Secures infrastructure (servers, storage, networking, physical data centers).

User → Secures applications, data, access control (IAM policies, encryption).


👉 Example: AWS secures S3 service, but you must set correct bucket permissions.


---

16. What is the difference between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling?

✅ Answer:

Vertical Scaling: Increase power of one server (more RAM/CPU).

Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers (instances).


👉 Example:

Vertical → Change EC2 from t2.micro → m5.large.

Horizontal → Add 5 EC2 servers with Load Balancer.



---

17. What is an Availability Zone and Region in AWS?

✅ Answer:

Region: A geographical area (e.g., Mumbai, US-East-1).

Availability Zone (AZ): A data center inside a region. A region has multiple AZs.


👉 Example: ap-south-1 (Mumbai region) has multiple AZs like ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b.


---

18. What is Elastic Container Service (ECS) and EKS?

✅ Answer:

ECS (Elastic Container Service): AWS service to run Docker containers.

EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes service.


👉 ECS is simple for Docker; EKS is for complex workloads with Kubernetes.


---

19. What is CloudTrail?

✅ Answer:
CloudTrail records all API calls and user activities in AWS.
Helps in auditing and security.

👉 Example: If someone deleted an S3 bucket, CloudTrail log will show who did it and when.


---

20. What is a Security Group in AWS?

✅ Answer:
Security Group is a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.

Controls inbound (incoming) and outbound (outgoing) traffic.

Works at instance level.


👉 Example: Allow only HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).

Bhai 👌 tum AWS ke Free Tier Plan ki baat kar rahe ho. Ye interview me bhi common sawaal hai, specially Cloud Nexus jaise company ke liye.
AWS Free Tier basically teen type ka hota hai:


---

☁ AWS Free Tier Features (Important for Interview)


---

🔹 1. Always Free (Hamesha Free Rehta Hai)

Yeh services hamesha free rahte hain (with some limits):

AWS Lambda → 1 million free requests per month + 400,000 GB-seconds compute time.
