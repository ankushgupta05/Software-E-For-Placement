Got it 👍 Let’s make it super easy English now:


---

🌟 What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for making Single Page Web Applications (SPA).

👉 Single Page Application means:

The full page does not reload again and again.

Only the part that changes gets updated.

This makes the website fast and smooth.


Example:
On YouTube, when you like a video → only the like button changes, the whole page does not reload.


---

🔑 Important Features of React

1. Component-Based → Website is made of small parts (components) like Header, Button, Footer.


2. Virtual DOM → React updates changes faster using a copy of the real DOM.


3. Reusable Components → One button code can be used many times.


4. One-way Data Flow → Data goes from parent → child only.


5. JSX → You can write HTML inside JavaScript.




---

🏗 MVC Architecture (Simple)

MVC = Model – View – Controller

Model → Data (like database).

View → What the user sees (UI).

Controller → Connects Model and View.


👉 React is mostly used for the View part.


---

📦 Props and State in React

1. Props (Properties)

Like arguments in a function.

Data is sent from parent to child component.

Cannot be changed by the child (read-only).


Example:

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Use
<Welcome name="Ankush" />

👉 Output: Hello, Ankush


---

2. State

Like a variable inside a component.

Can change when needed.

Useful for user actions.


Example:

import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
    </>
  );
}

👉 Every time you click, the number increases.


---

✅ Remember in short:

ReactJS → Makes Single Page Applications.

Props → Data from parent, cannot change.

State → Data inside component, can change.

Do you want me to also make a small table (Props vs State) in easy English so you can revise quickly before exams/interviews?


Okay 👍 let’s make it very easy for you.


---

🔹 What are Hooks in React?

👉 Definition:
Hooks are special functions in React that let you use state and other React features (like lifecycle methods) in functional components without writing class components.

Think of them as tools that allow functional components to “hook into” React features.


---

🔹 Types of Hooks in React (with simple definitions)

1. useState

👉 Used to add state in a functional component.

Example: Store a counter value.


import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}


---

2. useEffect

👉 Used to perform side effects (like fetching data, timers, updating DOM).

Runs after the component renders.


import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted or updated!");
  }, []); // [] means run only once
}


---

3. useContext

👉 Allows you to use context API directly, for passing data without props drilling.

const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <p>Theme is {theme}</p>;
}


---

4. useRef

👉 Used to access DOM elements or store mutable values that don’t re-render.

function InputFocus() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}


---

5. useMemo

👉 Used to optimize performance by memoizing (saving) calculated values.

const result = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(num), [num]);


---

6. useCallback

👉 Returns a memoized function, prevents re-creation of functions on re-render.

const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, []);


---

7. useReducer

👉 Used for complex state management (like Redux but inside component).

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });


---

✅ Summary (Very Easy):

useState → For state

useEffect → For side effects

useContext → For context

useRef → For DOM/mutable values

useMemo → For memoized values

useCallback → For memoized functions

useReducer → For complex state
