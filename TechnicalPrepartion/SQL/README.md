👉 Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce **redundancy** and improve **data integrity**.

* Example: Splitting one big table into smaller related tables.

---

**9. What is denormalization, and when is it used?**
👉 Denormalization is the process of combining normalized tables into fewer tables to improve **read performance**.

* It is used in reporting systems or data warehouses where **fast queries** are needed.

---

**10. What is a query in SQL?**
