Absolutely! Let's break this down step by step in the **simplest way possible**, covering **all concepts** related to **Load Factor**, Hash Tables, and the options given.

## 🔍 **What is a Hash Table?**

A **hash table** is a **data structure** that stores data in an **array** using a **hash function**. It provides **fast insertion, deletion, and lookup** — typically in **O(1)** time.

---

## 📘 **What is Load Factor (α) in a Hash Table?**

The **load factor** (denoted as **α**) tells us:

> "On average, how many elements are stored per slot in the hash table?"

---

### 🧠 **Load Factor Formula:**

$$
\text{Load Factor (α)} = \frac{\text{Number of Elements}}{\text{Number of Slots in Hash Table}}
$$

* **Number of Elements** = How many items you're storing
* **Number of Slots** = Size of the hash table (total available buckets or indices)

---

## ✅ **Given in the question:**

* Number of **slots** in the hash table $T$ = **25**
* Number of **elements** stored in it = **2000**

---

### 🧮 Step-by-Step Calculation:

$$
\alpha = \frac{2000}{25} = 80
$$

---

## ✅ **Answer: A. 80**

---

## 🔍 What does it mean in real terms?

* You have only **25 places (slots)** to store data.
* But you are trying to store **2000 items**.
* On **average**, each slot has **80 items**.
* This is only possible if you're using **chaining** (not open addressing).

---

## 💡 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine:

* You have **25 lockers** in a school.
* But **2000 students** need to store their bags.
* So, each locker ends up holding **80 bags**!

That’s exactly what a **load factor of 80** means.

## 🔄 Two Common Hashing Techniques:

| Hashing Type        | Load Factor Limit | How Items are Stored                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Open Addressing** | α ≤ 1             | Items are stored **within** the table |
| **Chaining**        | α > 1 is allowed  | Each slot can hold a **linked list**  |

Since α = 80 here, it's clear that **chaining is being used**.

## ❌ Why the other options are wrong:

| Option | Value  | Why it's Wrong?                                                         |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B      | 0.0125 | This would mean 25 elements in 2000 slots (reverse case)                |
| C      | 8000   | Completely wrong math (2000×4?)                                         |
| D      | 1.25   | Would be correct if elements were 31.25 in 25 slots (not matching here) |

---

## ✅ Final Summary:

| Concept                    | Value                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Elements (n)               | 2000                    |
| Slots (m)                  | 25                      |
| Load Factor (α = n/m)      | 80                      |
| Correct Option             | ✅ A                     |
| Hashing Method Likely Used | Chaining (due to α > 1) |
