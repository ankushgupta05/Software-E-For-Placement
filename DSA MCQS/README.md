Ok, Ankush — let’s go **step-by-step** so it’s super simple.
We’ll first understand **two important terms**, then I’ll give you **a clear table** with **real, daily-life examples** for each sorting algorithm.

---

## **1️⃣ Two Important Words**

### **Stable Algorithm**

* **Meaning**: If two items have the same value, **their order stays the same** after sorting.
* **Example**:
  Imagine you have a list of students sorted by **age**, and two are both 20 years old. If they were listed as
  `Ravi (20), Sita (20)` before sorting,
  a **stable sort** will keep them as `Ravi, Sita` (same order), not `Sita, Ravi`.

---

### **Extra Space**

* **Meaning**: Does the algorithm need **another array or memory** to work?
* **Example**:
  If I’m sorting clothes and I put them in another basket before arranging them, I’m using **extra space**.
  If I sort them right inside the same basket without taking them out, that’s **in-place**.

## **2️⃣ Table — With Simple Language & Real Applications**

| Algorithm          | Best Time  | Average Time    | Worst Time | Stable? | Extra Space?                    | Real-Life Example                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Selection Sort** | O(n²)      | O(n²)           | O(n²)      | ❌ No    | ✅ No extra (O(1))               | Picking the **smallest mango** from a pile, keeping it aside, repeating |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n)       | O(n²)           | O(n²)      | ✅ Yes   | ✅ No extra (O(1))               | **Arranging playing cards** in your hand                                |
| **Bubble Sort**    | O(n)       | O(n²)           | O(n²)      | ✅ Yes   | ✅ No extra (O(1))               | **Sorting books by height** by repeatedly swapping wrong ones           |
| **Quick Sort**     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)      | O(n²)      | ❌ No    | ⚠️ Needs small extra (O(log n)) | Sorting **contacts in a phone** very fast                               |
| **Merge Sort**     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)      | O(n log n) | ✅ Yes   | ❌ Needs extra array (O(n))      | **Merging two sorted playlists** into one big sorted playlist           |
| **Shell Sort**     | O(n log n) | Around O(n^1.5) | O(n²)      | ❌ No    | ✅ No extra (O(1))               | Organizing files in a cupboard in **gaps**, then smaller gaps           |
| **Radix Sort**     | O(nk)      | O(nk)           | O(nk)      | ✅ Yes   | ❌ Needs extra (O(n+k))          | Sorting **phone numbers or roll numbers** digit by digit                |

---

## **3️⃣ How to Remember Applications**

* **Selection Sort** → Pick smallest each time → like **finding smallest mango**.
* **Insertion Sort** → Insert each new thing in correct place → like **playing cards**.
* **Bubble Sort** → Swap neighbors repeatedly → like **sorting books by height**.
* **Quick Sort** → Fast divide & conquer → like **splitting phone contacts list into groups**.
* **Merge Sort** → Merge sorted groups → like **merging playlists**.
* **Shell Sort** → Sort far apart items first → like **organizing cupboard in large steps, then fine steps**.
* **Radix Sort** → Sort digit by digit → like **sorting phone numbers**.

Sure! Here’s a set of **sample technical MCQs** (like you might get in a campus placement test), with **answers and short explanations** — in the same style as the binary search question you just asked.

---

# 💻✨ **Sample Technical MCQs with Answers**

---

## **Q1. What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array (by index)?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

✅ **Answer:** A) O(1)

**Explanation:** Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, so you can directly jump to any index.

---

## **Q2. What is the worst-case time complexity of linear search?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

✅ **Answer:** C) O(n)

**Explanation:** In worst case, the element is not present, or is at the last position, so we need to check all elements.

---

## **Q3. Which data structure is used in recursion internally?**

A) Queue
B) Stack
C) Linked List
D) Heap

✅ **Answer:** B) Stack

**Explanation:** Recursive function calls are stored in the function call stack.

---

## **Q4. What is the worst-case number of comparisons in binary search on a sorted array of n elements?**

A) log₂(n)
B) n
C) √n
D) n log n

✅ **Answer:** A) log₂(n)

**Explanation:** Each step halves the search space; so maximum log₂(n) steps.

---

## **Q5. Which of the following sorting algorithms is not comparison-based?**

A) Quick Sort
B) Merge Sort
C) Counting Sort
D) Heap Sort

✅ **Answer:** C) Counting Sort

**Explanation:** Counting sort works by counting frequencies, not comparing elements directly.

---

## **Q6. Which of the following data structures provides O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search (average case)?**

A) Array
B) Linked List
C) Hash Table
D) Stack

✅ **Answer:** C) Hash Table

**Explanation:** Hash table operations take O(1) average case time due to hashing.

---

## **Q7. What is the space complexity of recursive binary search?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

✅ **Answer:** B) O(log n)

**Explanation:** Due to recursive calls using stack space proportional to height of recursion tree (log n levels).

---

## **Q8. In a min-heap, the smallest element is at which position?**

A) Root node
B) Any leaf node
C) Last node
D) Any internal node

✅ **Answer:** A) Root node

**Explanation:** In a min-heap, by definition, root is always the minimum.

---

## **Q9. Which traversal method gives sorted order in a binary search tree?**

A) Pre-order
B) Post-order
C) In-order
D) Level-order

✅ **Answer:** C) In-order

**Explanation:** In-order traversal of BST gives elements in non-decreasing order.

---

## **Q10. What is the time complexity to insert an element in a linked list at the beginning?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

✅ Let’s first solve **this question step by step**, and then I’ll give you **more such MCQ questions with answers** (for campus prep).

---

# 💡 **Question given**

Initial array:

```
10, 4, 7, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## ✨ **Insertion sort working**

Insertion sort works by moving from left to right, **inserting each element into its correct place among already sorted left part**.

---

## **Pass 1** (index 1)

Key = 4

Compare with 10 → 4 < 10 → shift 10 to right.

Result:

```
4, 10, 7, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## **Pass 2** (index 2)

Key = 7

Compare with 10 → 7 < 10 → shift 10 right.

Compare with 4 → 7 > 4 → stop.

Result:

```
4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## **Pass 3** (index 3)

Key = 23

Compare with 10 → 23 > 10 → stop.

Result (no change):

```
4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## ✅ After third pass

```
4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

### **Correct option**

> **Option B: 4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5**
