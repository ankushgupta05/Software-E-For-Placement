Sure! Hereâ€™s a set of **sample technical MCQs** (like you might get in a campus placement test), with **answers and short explanations** â€” in the same style as the binary search question you just asked.

# ðŸ’»âœ¨ **Sample Technical MCQs with Answers**

---

## **Q1. What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array (by index)?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

âœ… **Answer:** A) O(1)

**Explanation:** Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, so you can directly jump to any index.

---

## **Q2. What is the worst-case time complexity of linear search?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

âœ… **Answer:** C) O(n)

**Explanation:** In worst case, the element is not present, or is at the last position, so we need to check all elements.

---

## **Q3. Which data structure is used in recursion internally?**

A) Queue
B) Stack
C) Linked List
D) Heap

âœ… **Answer:** B) Stack

**Explanation:** Recursive function calls are stored in the function call stack.

---

## **Q4. What is the worst-case number of comparisons in binary search on a sorted array of n elements?**

A) logâ‚‚(n)
B) n
C) âˆšn
D) n log n

âœ… **Answer:** A) logâ‚‚(n)

**Explanation:** Each step halves the search space; so maximum logâ‚‚(n) steps.

---

## **Q5. Which of the following sorting algorithms is not comparison-based?**

A) Quick Sort
B) Merge Sort
C) Counting Sort
D) Heap Sort

âœ… **Answer:** C) Counting Sort

**Explanation:** Counting sort works by counting frequencies, not comparing elements directly.

---

## **Q6. Which of the following data structures provides O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search (average case)?**

A) Array
B) Linked List
C) Hash Table
D) Stack

âœ… **Answer:** C) Hash Table

**Explanation:** Hash table operations take O(1) average case time due to hashing.

---

## **Q7. What is the space complexity of recursive binary search?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

âœ… **Answer:** B) O(log n)

**Explanation:** Due to recursive calls using stack space proportional to height of recursion tree (log n levels).

---

## **Q8. In a min-heap, the smallest element is at which position?**

A) Root node
B) Any leaf node
C) Last node
D) Any internal node

âœ… **Answer:** A) Root node

**Explanation:** In a min-heap, by definition, root is always the minimum.

---

## **Q9. Which traversal method gives sorted order in a binary search tree?**

A) Pre-order
B) Post-order
C) In-order
D) Level-order

âœ… **Answer:** C) In-order

**Explanation:** In-order traversal of BST gives elements in non-decreasing order.

---

## **Q10. What is the time complexity to insert an element in a linked list at the beginning?**

A) O(1)
B) O(log n)
C) O(n)
D) O(n log n)

âœ… **Answer:** A) O(1)

**Explanation:** You only need to update pointers at head, no traversal needed.

âœ… Letâ€™s first solve **this question step by step**, and then Iâ€™ll give you **more such MCQ questions with answers** (for campus prep).

---

# ðŸ’¡ **Question given**

Initial array:

```
10, 4, 7, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## âœ¨ **Insertion sort working**

Insertion sort works by moving from left to right, **inserting each element into its correct place among already sorted left part**.

---

## **Pass 1** (index 1)

Key = 4

Compare with 10 â†’ 4 < 10 â†’ shift 10 to right.

Result:

```
4, 10, 7, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## **Pass 2** (index 2)

Key = 7

Compare with 10 â†’ 7 < 10 â†’ shift 10 right.

Compare with 4 â†’ 7 > 4 â†’ stop.

Result:

```
4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## **Pass 3** (index 3)

Key = 23

Compare with 10 â†’ 23 > 10 â†’ stop.

Result (no change):

```
4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

## âœ… After third pass

```
4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5
```

---

### **Correct option**

> **Option B: 4, 7, 10, 23, 67, 12, 5**
