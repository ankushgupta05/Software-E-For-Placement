Perfect üëç I‚Äôll keep 13 as it is and just add 14, 15, 16 in the same list.

13. What Are the Different Types of Errors in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, errors occur when the program breaks due to invalid code or unexpected behavior. The main types are:

Syntax Error ‚Äì Occurs when code is written incorrectly (e.g., missing brackets, semicolon).

Reference Error ‚Äì When trying to use a variable that is not defined.

Type Error ‚Äì Happens when a value is not of the expected type (e.g., calling a number as a function).

Range Error ‚Äì When a value is not within the allowed range (e.g., new Array(-5)).

Eval Error ‚Äì Related to the eval() function (rarely used in modern JavaScript).

URI Error ‚Äì When incorrect decodeURI() or encodeURI() functions are used.

14. What Is Memoization in JavaScript?

Memoization means saving function results so that next time the same input comes, it does not calculate again.

It makes the program faster.


üëâ Example:

function add(a, b) {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  return a + b;
}

let cache = {};
function memoAdd(a, b) {
  let key = a + "," + b;
  if (cache[key]) {
    return cache[key];   // return saved value
  }
  cache[key] = add(a, b); // save result
  return cache[key];
}

console.log(memoAdd(2, 3)); // Calculates
console.log(memoAdd(2, 3)); // Uses saved value

15. What Is the Use of a Constructor Function in JavaScript?

Constructor function is used to make many objects quickly.

It works like a blueprint.

Always used with new keyword.


üëâ Example:

function Car(name, model) {
  this.name = name;
  this.model = model;
}

let c1 = new Car("Toyota", 2022);
let c2 = new Car("Honda", 2023);

console.log(c1.name); // Toyota

16. What Is the Difference Between == and === in JavaScript?

== ‚Üí checks only value (does type conversion).

=== ‚Üí checks value and type both (strict checking).


üëâ Example:

console.log(5 == "5");  // true  (only value checked)
console.log(5 === "5"); // false (type different: number vs string)

Do you want me to also extend this list with 17, 18, 19 in the same easy and short style?
