Got it 👍 Here’s the simplified version with full forms:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) gives the structure of a webpage.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds style and design.
JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to make webpages interactive, dynamic, and user-friendly with features like form checking, animations, and live updates. ✅

Would you like me to make this even shorter for exam writing (just 2–3 lines)?
