Got it 👍 Here’s the simplified version with full forms:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) gives the structure of a webpage.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds style and design.
JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to make webpages interactive, dynamic, and user-friendly with features like form checking, animations, and live updates. ✅

Would you like me to make this even shorter for exam writing (just 2–3 lines)?



I think you meant "debugger" in JavaScript (not degger 🙂).

✅ Why we use debugger in JavaScript:

The debugger statement is used to pause the execution of JavaScript code at a specific point, so developers can check values, variables, and the flow of the program in detail.

When JavaScript encounters debugger, it stops running and opens debugging tools (like Chrome DevTools), allowing you to step through the code line by line.

🔹 Example:

let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let sum = a + b;

debugger; // Execution will pause here if DevTools is open

console.log("Sum is:", sum);

👉 When the browser reaches debugger;, execution pauses and you can inspect:

The values of a, b, and sum.

The call stack.

Scope and variables.

🔹 Why use it?

1. To find and fix bugs.


2. To inspect variables at a specific line.


3. To control execution flow during development.


4. Works like adding a breakpoint in DevTools.

⚡ In short:
We use debugger in JavaScript to pause code execution and inspect what’s happening inside the program at that exact moment.

Do you want me to also show you how to use debugger practically inside Chrome DevTools with an example?
