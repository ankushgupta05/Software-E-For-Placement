Got it 👍 Here’s the simplified version with full forms:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) gives the structure of a webpage.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds style and design.
JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to make webpages interactive, dynamic, and user-friendly with features like form checking, animations, and live updates. ✅

Would you like me to make this even shorter for exam writing (just 2–3 lines)?





### ✅ Question 2
❓ Why we use `debugger` in JavaScript?

---

✅ **Answer:**  
The `debugger` statement in JavaScript is used to **pause the execution** of code at a specific point, allowing developers to inspect variables, the call stack, and program flow using browser developer tools (like Chrome DevTools).

---

### 🔹 Example:
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let sum = a + b;

debugger; // Code execution will pause here if DevTools is open

console.log("Sum is:", sum);


---

🔍 Explanation:

When JavaScript encounters debugger, execution stops and opens the debugging environment. This helps developers check the current state of variables, step through code line by line, and find errors easily.


---

📘 Rule:

Use debugger; only during development.

Remove it before deploying code to production.


Do you also want me to include **Question 1** (JavaScript definition + HTML & CSS full forms) in the same `README.md` so it looks like a sequence?
