Alright 👍 Here’s a simple explanation of each in English with numbering (36, 37, 38, 39):


---

36. How Do You Handle Errors in JavaScript?

Errors in JavaScript are handled using the try...catch...finally block.

try → code that may cause an error.

catch → handles the error if it happens.

finally → runs code always (error or not).


👉 Example:

try {
  let num = 10 / 0;
  console.log(num);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error occurred: " + error.message);
} finally {
  console.log("This runs always.");
}



---

38. What Is the Difference Between querySelector and getElementById?

getElementById(id)

Finds an element only by its ID.

Returns one element.


querySelector(selector)

Finds the first element that matches a CSS selector (id, class, tag, etc.).

More powerful but may be slower.



👉 Example:

document.getElementById("myId");      // Only by ID
document.querySelector(".myClass");   // By class
document.querySelector("#myId");      // By ID (like getElementById)


---

39. What Is the Purpose of the setTimeout() Function in JavaScript?

setTimeout() is used to delay the execution of a function.

It runs the code once after a given time (in milliseconds).


👉 Example:

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Hello after 2 seconds!");
}, 2000);

(Here the message prints after 2 seconds.)


---

Do you want me to also cover setInterval() vs setTimeout() (since they are often asked together)?


Got it 👍 Let’s explain Event Bubbling in easy technical English:


---

🔹 What is Event Bubbling?

When you click (or trigger an event) on a child element, the event does not stop there.

It moves upward to the parent, then grandparent, then all the way up to the document.

This upward flow is called event bubbling.


👉 Flow = Child → Parent → Grandparent → Document


---

🔹 Example

<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>

document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
});

👉 If you click the button:

First → "Child clicked"

Then → "Parent clicked"


Because the event bubbled from child to parent.


---

🔹 How to Stop It?

1. event.stopPropagation()

Stops the event from going to parent.

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
  event.stopPropagation(); // ✅ stops bubbling
});

Now only "Child clicked" will show.


---

🔹 Simple Summary

Event Bubbling = Event moves upward (child → parent).

Problem = Sometimes parent event runs by mistake.

Solution = Use stopPropagation() to stop it.



---

Do you want me to also explain the opposite (Event Capturing: parent → child) in the same simple way?






Got it 👍 I’ll give you the complete definitions in easy English (same style as previous answers).
Let’s continue with 40, 41, 42, 43, 44:


---

40. How Can You Prevent the Default Behavior of an Event in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, some HTML elements have a default action.

Example: Clicking a link <a> opens another page.

Example: Submitting a form <form> reloads the page.


If you don’t want this to happen, you can use event.preventDefault() inside the event handler.

👉 Example:

document.querySelector("a").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // stops opening the link
  console.log("Default action prevented!");
});

✅ Definition: preventDefault() is used to stop the browser’s default behavior for an element’s event.


---

41. What Is the Difference Between localStorage and sessionStorage in JavaScript?

Both are part of the Web Storage API and are used to store data in the browser.

localStorage

Stores data with no time limit.

Data stays even after the browser is closed and reopened.

Shared between all tabs/windows of the same site.


sessionStorage

Stores data only for the current session/tab.

Data is removed when the tab or browser is closed.

Not shared across tabs.



👉 Example:

localStorage.setItem("name", "Alice");   // saved permanently
sessionStorage.setItem("age", "22");     // removed when tab closed

✅ Definition: localStorage saves data permanently (until cleared), while sessionStorage saves data only for one tab session.


---

42. How Can You Convert a String to Lowercase in JavaScript?

You can use the toLowerCase() method of strings.

It returns a new string where all characters are lowercase.

Original string is not changed.


👉 Example:

let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let lower = text.toLowerCase();
console.log(lower); // "hello world"

✅ Definition: toLowerCase() is a string method that converts all characters in a string to lowercase.


---

43. What Is the Purpose of the map() Function in JavaScript?

map() is an array method.

It is used to transform each element of an array.

It creates a new array with the results.

It does not change the original array.


👉 Example:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]

✅ Definition: map() is used to loop over an array and create a new array where each item is modified by a function.


---




Perfect 👍 Let’s continue with 45, 46, 47, 48 in the same easy + complete definition style:


---

45. What Is the Difference Between splice() and slice()?

Both are array methods, but they are very different:

slice(start, end)

Returns a new array from part of the original array.

Does not change the original array.


splice(start, deleteCount, items...)

Can add or remove elements from the array.

Changes the original array.



👉 Example:

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let sliced = arr.slice(1, 4);  // [2, 3, 4] (original not changed)
let spliced = arr.splice(2, 2); // removes [3, 4] (original changed)

console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 5]

✅ Definition: slice() makes a copy of part of an array, while splice() adds/removes elements and changes the original array.


---

46. What Is the Purpose of the reduce() Function in JavaScript?

reduce() is an array method.

It is used to reduce the whole array to a single value.

It takes a callback function and a starting value.


👉 Example: Sum of numbers:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);

console.log(sum); // 10

👉 Example: Multiply numbers:

let product = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc * curr, 1);
console.log(product); // 24

✅ Definition: reduce() applies a function to each element of the array and reduces it to a single result (like sum, product, etc.).


---

47. How Can You Check if an Array Includes a Certain Value in JavaScript?

You can use the includes() method.

Returns true if the value exists in the array.

Returns false if not found.


👉 Example:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

console.log(fruits.includes("banana")); // true
console.log(fruits.includes("orange")); // false

✅ Definition: includes() checks whether an array contains a specific value and returns true or false.


---

48. What Is the Difference Between Prototype and Instance Properties in JavaScript?

Prototype Properties

Belong to the prototype object of a class or constructor.

Shared by all objects created from that constructor.

Saves memory (only one copy is shared).


Instance Properties

Defined inside the constructor (using this).

Each object gets its own copy.



👉 Example:

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;   // instance property
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello, I am " + this.name); // prototype property
};

let p1 = new Person("Alice");
let p2 = new Person("Bob");

p1.sayHello(); // Hello, I am Alice
p2.sayHello(); // Hello, I am Bob

✅ Definition:

Instance properties → belong to each object separately.

Prototype properties → shared by all objects of the same type.



---





Alright 👍 let’s continue with 49, 50, 51, 53 in the same easy + complete style:


---

49. What Is the Difference Between an Array and an Object in JavaScript?

Array

Stores data in an ordered list (index-based: 0, 1, 2...).

Best for lists/collections (like numbers, names, items).

Access elements by index.


Object

Stores data as key–value pairs.

Best for describing things with properties.

Access elements by key.



👉 Example:

let arr = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]; // Array
console.log(arr[1]); // banana

let obj = {name: "Alice", age: 22}; // Object
console.log(obj.name); // Alice

✅ Definition: Arrays store ordered lists of values, while Objects store data in key–value form.


---

50. What Are the Different Events in JavaScript?

Events are actions that happen in the browser, and JavaScript can respond to them.

Some common events:

Mouse Events → click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove

Keyboard Events → keydown, keyup, keypress

Form Events → submit, change, focus, blur

Window Events → load, resize, scroll, unload

Touch Events (mobile) → touchstart, touchend, touchmove


👉 Example:

document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

✅ Definition: Events are browser actions (like click, key press, or form submit) that JavaScript can listen to and handle.


---

51. (Your skipped number – filling in)

I think you meant “What Is the Difference Between == and === in JavaScript?” (this usually comes around this section).

== (Loose Equality)

Compares values after type conversion.

Example: "5" == 5 → true


=== (Strict Equality)

Compares values without type conversion (type + value must match).

Example: "5" === 5 → false



👉 Example:

console.log(5 == "5");  // true
console.log(5 === "5"); // false

✅ Definition: == checks only values, while === checks both value and type.


---

53. What Are the Different Ways to Access an HTML Element in JavaScript?

You can access elements from the DOM in many ways:

1. By ID



document.getElementById("myId");

2. By Class Name



document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

3. By Tag Name



document.getElementsByTagName("p");

4. By CSS Selector (first match)



document.querySelector(".myClass");

5. By CSS Selector (all matches)



document.querySelectorAll("div");

✅ Definition: JavaScript provides different DOM methods (getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, querySelectorAll) to access HTML elements.


---

Okay 👍 Got it!
So for Question 55 (window object) the first answer I gave you was better ✅.

Here it is again in the same simple style 👇


---

55. What Is the Purpose of the window Object in JavaScript?

In a browser, window is the global object.

Everything in JavaScript (like alert(), setTimeout(), document) comes under window.

It represents the browser window where the page is shown.


🔹 Example:

console.log(window.innerWidth);   // width of the browser window
console.log(window.innerHeight);  // height of the browser window

window.alert("Hello from window!"); // alert box

👉 Even if you write alert("hi"), it’s actually window.alert("hi").

✅ Purpose:

Acts as a global scope for variables & functions.

Provides properties/methods to control the browser window.

Holds the document object (DOM).



---

Would you like me to also shorten 54 and 56 in the same simple style like this one?





Perfect 👍 I’ll rewrite 54 and 56 in the same simple style as 55 (the one you liked).


---

54. What Are the Different Ways to Create Objects in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, objects are used to store data in key–value pairs.
There are 5 common ways to create objects:

1. Object Literal (most common):



let person = { name: "Ankush", age: 22 };

2. Using new Object():



let car = new Object();
car.brand = "Tata";

3. Using Constructor Function:



function Student(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
let s1 = new Student("Ankush");

4. Using ES6 Class:



class Animal {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
}
let dog = new Animal("Dog");

5. Using Object.create():



let parent = { greet: () => "Hello" };
let child = Object.create(parent);

✅ In short: Objects can be created using Literal, new Object(), Constructor, Class, or Object.create().


---

56. What Is Callback Hell?

A callback is a function passed to another function to run later.

Callback Hell happens when too many callbacks are nested, making the code look messy and hard to read.


🔹 Example of Callback Hell:

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("1");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("2");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("3");
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);

😵 This looks confusing → called "Pyramid of Doom".

✅ Solution: Use Promises or async/await.

🔹 With async/await (clean way):

async function steps() {
  console.log("1");
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));
  console.log("2");
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));
  console.log("3");
}
steps();

✅ In short:
Callback Hell = too many nested callbacks.
Solution = use Promises or async/await for clean code.

Do you want me to now put 54, 55, 56 together in one neat block (like notes for revision)?
