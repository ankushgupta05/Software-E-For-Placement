Alright 👍 Here’s a simple explanation of each in English with numbering (36, 37, 38, 39):


---

36. How Do You Handle Errors in JavaScript?

Errors in JavaScript are handled using the try...catch...finally block.

try → code that may cause an error.

catch → handles the error if it happens.

finally → runs code always (error or not).


👉 Example:

try {
  let num = 10 / 0;
  console.log(num);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error occurred: " + error.message);
} finally {
  console.log("This runs always.");
}



---

38. What Is the Difference Between querySelector and getElementById?

getElementById(id)

Finds an element only by its ID.

Returns one element.


querySelector(selector)

Finds the first element that matches a CSS selector (id, class, tag, etc.).

More powerful but may be slower.



👉 Example:

document.getElementById("myId");      // Only by ID
document.querySelector(".myClass");   // By class
document.querySelector("#myId");      // By ID (like getElementById)


---

39. What Is the Purpose of the setTimeout() Function in JavaScript?

setTimeout() is used to delay the execution of a function.

It runs the code once after a given time (in milliseconds).


👉 Example:

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Hello after 2 seconds!");
}, 2000);

(Here the message prints after 2 seconds.)


---

Do you want me to also cover setInterval() vs setTimeout() (since they are often asked together)?


Got it 👍 Let’s explain Event Bubbling in easy technical English:


---

🔹 What is Event Bubbling?

When you click (or trigger an event) on a child element, the event does not stop there.

It moves upward to the parent, then grandparent, then all the way up to the document.

This upward flow is called event bubbling.


👉 Flow = Child → Parent → Grandparent → Document


---

🔹 Example

<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>

document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
});

👉 If you click the button:

First → "Child clicked"

Then → "Parent clicked"


Because the event bubbled from child to parent.


---

🔹 How to Stop It?

1. event.stopPropagation()

Stops the event from going to parent.

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
  event.stopPropagation(); // ✅ stops bubbling
});

Now only "Child clicked" will show.


---

🔹 Simple Summary

Event Bubbling = Event moves upward (child → parent).

Problem = Sometimes parent event runs by mistake.

Solution = Use stopPropagation() to stop it.



---

Do you want me to also explain the opposite (Event Capturing: parent → child) in the same simple way?
