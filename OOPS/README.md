Here's a polished and clean version of your explanation, perfect for a `README.md` file:

## 🧠 What's the Difference?

### 🔸 Copy Constructor

A special function in C++ used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.

```cpp
ClassName(const ClassName &obj);
```

---

### 🔸 Shallow Copy

* Copies only the **memory address** (pointer).
* Both objects share the **same memory**.
* Changes in one affect the other.

```cpp
// Example
obj2 = obj1;  // Shallow copy
```

🛑 **Risk:** If one object deletes the pointer, the other will point to invalid memory.

---

### 🔸 Deep Copy

* Copies the **actual values** by allocating **new memory**.
* Both objects become **independent**.
* Safe from memory-related issues.

```cpp
// Example inside copy constructor
obj2.ptr = new int(*obj1.ptr);
```

✅ **Summary**

| Concept          | Memory Used            | Are Objects Independent? | Risk                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Copy Constructor | Depends (shallow/deep) | ❓ Depends                | ❓ Depends           |
| Shallow Copy     | Same pointer           | ❌ No                     | ⚠️ Dangling pointer |
| Deep Copy        | New memory             | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Safe              |
