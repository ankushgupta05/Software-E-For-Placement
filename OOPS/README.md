🧠 What’s the difference?
🔸 Copy Constructor:
A special function in C++ that copies one object into another.

🔸 Shallow Copy:
Just copies the address of pointer data (not the real value).
➡️ Both objects point to same memory.

🔸 Deep Copy:
Copies actual values also, by creating new memory.
➡️ Both objects are independent.
