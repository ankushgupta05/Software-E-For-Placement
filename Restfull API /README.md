Here’s the easy version with the question included:

Q: What is a RESTful API and why do we use it?

A:
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for different software applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Why we use it:

1. Simple and fast – works over normal web protocols.


2. Flexible – can be used with any programming language.


3. Scalable – easy to expand as the app grows.


4. Stateless – each request is independent, making it easier to manage.



Example:
A weather app asks a server for today’s temperature using a RESTful API, and the server sends the data back in JSON format.

I can also make a super short 1-line version that’s perfect for interviews. Do you want me to do that?

Q: What is the difference between REST and SOAP?

A:

REST (Representational State Transfer): A simple and fast way for apps to communicate over the web, usually using JSON.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): A strict and formal way to exchange data between apps, always using XML.

Q: What are status codes? Give examples (200, 201, 400, 404, 500).

A:
Status codes are numbers sent by a server to tell the client (like a web browser or app) how a request went.

Examples:

200 OK – Request was successful.

201 Created – New resource was successfully created.

400 Bad Request – The client sent invalid data.

404 Not Found – The requested resource does not exist.

500 Internal Server Error – The server had an error.


Summary:
Status codes help clients understand if their request worked or if something went wrong.

If you want, I can also make a super short 1-line version for quick interview answers.




Here’s a simple explanation with the question included:


---

Q: What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

A:

PUT: Updates the entire resource. If some fields are missing, they may be overwritten.

PATCH: Updates only specific fields of a resource, leaving the rest unchanged.


Example:

PUT: Update a user → must send name, email, age every time.

PATCH: Update a user’s email → only send the email field.


Summary:

PUT = full update

PATCH = partial update

I can also make a 1-line version for interviews if you want.



Here’s a simple explanation for all three questions:


---

Q6: What is statelessness in REST?

A:
Statelessness means that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to process it.

The server does not store any client session between requests.


Example:
If a client asks for user data, it must send the user ID every time; the server won’t remember previous requests.


---

Q7: What is idempotency in HTTP methods?

A:
Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once.

Example:

GET /users → safe and idempotent (no changes).

PUT /users/1 → idempotent (updating the same user with same data multiple times gives same result).

POST /users → not idempotent (creates new users every time).



---

Q8: How do you handle authentication in REST APIs? (JWT, OAuth2, API keys)

A:
Authentication ensures only authorized users can access resources. Common methods:

1. JWT (JSON Web Token): Client gets a token after login and sends it with each request.


2. OAuth2: Users log in via a third-party service (like Google) to get access tokens.


3. API keys: Server issues a unique key to the client, which must be sent with each request.

If you want, I can make super short 1-line versions of all three for interviews.
