Here‚Äôs the easy version with the question included:


---

Q: What is a RESTful API and why do we use it?

A:
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for different software applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Why we use it:

1. Simple and fast ‚Äì works over normal web protocols.


2. Flexible ‚Äì can be used with any programming language.


3. Scalable ‚Äì easy to expand as the app grows.


4. Stateless ‚Äì each request is independent, making it easier to manage.



Example:
A weather app asks a server for today‚Äôs temperature using a RESTful API, and the server sends the data back in JSON format.

Q: What is the difference between REST and SOAP?

A:

REST (Representational State Transfer): A simple and fast way for apps to communicate over the web, usually using JSON.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): A strict and formal way to exchange data between apps, always using XML.

Here‚Äôs an easy explanation with the question included:


---

Q: What are status codes? Give examples (200, 201, 400, 404, 500).

A:
Status codes are numbers sent by a server to tell the client (like a web browser or app) how a request went.

Examples:

200 OK ‚Äì Request was successful.

201 Created ‚Äì New resource was successfully created.

400 Bad Request ‚Äì The client sent invalid data.

404 Not Found ‚Äì The requested resource does not exist.

500 Internal Server Error ‚Äì The server had an error.


Summary:
Status codes help clients understand if their request worked or if something went wrong.

If you want, I can also make a super short 1-line version for quick interview answers.




Here‚Äôs a simple explanation with the question included:


---

Q: What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

A:

PUT: Updates the entire resource. If some fields are missing, they may be overwritten.

PATCH: Updates only specific fields of a resource, leaving the rest unchanged.


Example:

PUT: Update a user ‚Üí must send name, email, age every time.

PATCH: Update a user‚Äôs email ‚Üí only send the email field.


Summary:

PUT = full update

PATCH = partial update

I can also make a 1-line version for interviews if you want.



Here‚Äôs a simple explanation for all three questions:


---

Q6: What is statelessness in REST?

A:
Statelessness means that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to process it.

The server does not store any client session between requests.


Example:
If a client asks for user data, it must send the user ID every time; the server won‚Äôt remember previous requests.


---

Q7: What is idempotency in HTTP methods?

A:
Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once.

Example:

GET /users ‚Üí safe and idempotent (no changes).

PUT /users/1 ‚Üí idempotent (updating the same user with same data multiple times gives same result).

POST /users ‚Üí not idempotent (creates new users every time).



---

Q8: How do you handle authentication in REST APIs? (JWT, OAuth2, API keys)

A:
Authentication ensures only authorized users can access resources. Common methods:

1. JWT (JSON Web Token): Client gets a token after login and sends it with each request.


2. OAuth2: Users log in via a third-party service (like Google) to get access tokens.


3. API keys: Server issues a unique key to the client, which must be sent with each request.




---

If you want, I can make super short 1-line versions of all three for interviews.




Here‚Äôs a simple explanation for all three questions:


---

Q9: What is CORS and how do you handle it in Python?

A:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature in browsers that blocks requests from one domain to another unless allowed by the server.

Handling in Python (Flask/Django):

Flask: Use flask-cors library:


from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)

Django: Add 'corsheaders' middleware and configure allowed origins in settings.py.

Q10: Difference between REST and GraphQL

Feature	REST	GraphQL

Data fetching	Multiple endpoints for different data	Single endpoint, client specifies what it needs
Over/Under fetching	Possible	Avoided
Flexibility	Fixed responses	Highly flexible
Complexity	Simple	Slightly complex
Versioning	Often needed	Usually not needed


Summary:

REST = multiple endpoints, fixed data.

GraphQL = single endpoint, client decides data structure.



Okay ‚úÖ Here‚Äôs a long but very simple version with table so you can revise quickly:


---

üîπ Authentication

üëâ Who are you?

It is the process of checking the identity of the user.

Done using username & password, OTP, fingerprint, token, etc.

Always happens first before authorization.


Example:
You enter your email and password to log in ‚Üí The system checks if it‚Äôs correct ‚Üí ‚úÖ Authentication successful.


---

üîπ Authorization

üëâ What can you do?

It is the process of checking permissions and access rights of the user.

Decides what data or features you can access after login.

Happens after authentication.


Example:
You logged in ‚Üí Now you try to open the admin panel ‚Üí If you are an Admin, access is allowed, otherwise denied ‚Üí ‚úÖ Authorization.


---

‚úÖ Authentication vs Authorization (Easy Table)

Feature	Authentication (Who are you?)	Authorization (What can you do?)

Definition	Verifying user identity	Verifying user‚Äôs access rights
Purpose	To confirm the user is real	To control what user can access
When it happens	First step (before authz)	After authentication
Based on	Credentials (ID, password, OTP, biometrics, tokens)	Roles, permissions, policies
Example	Login with email & password	Only admin can delete a user



---

üëâ Short Analogy:

Authentication = Showing ID card at the gate üö™

Authorization = Areas you are allowed to enter inside üè¢



---

Do you want me to also add a real-life software example (like Gmail or Banking app) to make it even clearer for interviews?

Got it üëç Here‚Äôs the **full easy answer**, including **Starlette explanation**:

---

## ‚úÖ What is FastAPI and why is it called "fast"?

* **FastAPI** is a **Python framework** for building APIs (backend services).
* It is called **‚Äúfast‚Äù** because:

  1. **Speed for computers** ‚Äì It uses **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)** and a library called **Starlette** under the hood. This makes requests run **much faster** compared to Flask or Django REST.
  2. **Speed for developers** ‚Äì It automatically generates **API documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc)** and does **data validation** with **Pydantic**, so developers write less code and work faster.

üëâ So "fast" = **fast for computers + fast for developers**.

---

## ‚≠ê What is Starlette in FastAPI?

* **Starlette** is a **high-performance library** that FastAPI is built on.
* It provides the **core web features**:

  * Handling routes (which URL ‚Üí which function).
  * Middleware (extra steps like authentication, logging).
  * Background tasks.
  * WebSockets (real-time features like chat).

üëâ Think of it like this:

* **Starlette** = the **engine** of the car üöó (makes it run fast).
* **FastAPI** = the **car body + dashboard** (gives structure, comfort, and tools like docs & validation).

So, when you use FastAPI, **Starlette is silently doing the heavy lifting under the hood**.

---

## ‚úÖ How is FastAPI different from Flask or Django REST Framework (DRF)?

| Feature             | **FastAPI**                            | **Flask**                               | **Django REST Framework (DRF)**          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**           | Very fast (async support built-in)     | Slower (no async by default)            | Slower than FastAPI                      |
| **Ease of Use**     | Easy, with automatic docs              | Simple, but docs must be added manually | More complex setup                       |
| **Data Validation** | Built-in with **Pydantic**             | Manual (you write extra code)           | Built-in with **Serializers**            |
| **Best For**        | Modern APIs, microservices, async apps | Small projects, simple APIs             | Large projects with heavy business logic |
| **Docs**            | Auto-generated Swagger & ReDoc         | Not auto (needs extra setup)            | Browsable API but not Swagger by default |

---

## üëâ In short:

* **FastAPI** = Fast, modern, async, automatic docs (built on Starlette).
* **Flask** = Simple, flexible, but you do everything manually.
* **DRF** = Powerful, feature-rich, but heavier and slower.

---

Do you want me to also add a **small diagram (FastAPI ‚Üí Starlette ‚Üí ASGI ‚Üí Server)** to make the architecture super clear?
