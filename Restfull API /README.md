Q: What is a RESTful API and why do we use it?

A:
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for different software applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Why we use it:

1. Simple and fast – works over normal web protocols.


2. Flexible – can be used with any programming language.


3. Scalable – easy to expand as the app grows.


4. Stateless – each request is independent, making it easier to manage.



Example:
A weather app asks a server for today’s temperature using a RESTful API, and the server sends the data back in JSON format.
